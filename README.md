# DataStructuresApp
This is the implementation of my data structures app, written in Kotlin, that gives descriptions of 6 common data structures in computer science:
1) Trees
2) Queues
3) Dictionaries
4) Circular Arrays
5) Stacks
6) Linked Lists

Within the app, users are given the option to open and view my DataStructuresImplementation respository which gives the actual implementation of each data structure in 
Java with helpful Java Documentation.
